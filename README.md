# CompassBG
Automatically set a wallpaper with the Compass schedule 


## WARNING!!! THIS SCRIPT SAVES YOUR COMPASS LOGIN CREDENTIALS AS PLAIN TEXT IN A JSON CONFIGURATION FILE. DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE.


## Dependencies:

	Windows 10 (11 would probably work as well)


## Instructions:

Step 1:
	Create a directory with wallpaper images

Step 2:
	Place the CompassBG folder in install location
	(The optional startup shortcut generated by the setup assistant will break if the CompassBG directory is moved)

Step 3:
	Create a configuration file by running compassbg.exe manually 
	(configure all required settings, then press Apply and exit)
	
	This will create:
	
	1. CompassBG directory in Appdata with a configuration file inside it

	2. (Optional) compassbgw.lnk in Startup folder

	And then apply the schedule to the wallpaper.

Step 4 (Optional):
	Set up compassbgw.exe (no console version) to run at startup through either:
	
	1. Run on startup option in setup assistant

	2. Run on log on in Task Scheduler (Windows prioritises this over startup so it is faster than option 1)
		
		(My settings for Task Scheduler)
		Triggers:
			At log on of any user
			At 12:00 AM every day
		Action: 
			Start a program: Program/Script: "C:\location\compassbgw.exe"
		Conditions:
			None
